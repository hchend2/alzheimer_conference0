# alzheimer_conference0

You are currently viewing alzheimer_confenrence0 project's README file. 
In this project i am building a dadabase named "alzheimer_team". A collection of papers are submitted to the conference, each of which has a unique paper ID, a list of authors (names, affiliations, emails) in the order of contribution significance, title, abstract, and a PDF file for its content. The conference has a list of program committee (PC) members to review the papers. To ensure review quality, each paper is assigned to 3 PC members for review. To avoid overloading, each PC member is assigned to at most 5 papers, assuming that there are enough PC members. Each review report consists of a report ID, a description of review comment, a final recommendation (accept, reject), and the date the review report is submitted. A PC member can submit at most one review report for the paper that is assigned to him/her.
